# vertx-web-groovy-dsl
A simple Groovy DSL to declare Vert.x Apex routes


This projects aims at providing another way to define your web routes with vert-web if you're using Groovy, in a more Groovy-ish manner.


The most interesting feature is the ability to declare routers and sub-routers in a nested way with nested closures.


Take a look at the `routes.groovy` in the [test folder](src/test/resources/routes.groovy) to have a glimpse at what you can do.


Still a work in progress, more syntaxic sugar to come :)
